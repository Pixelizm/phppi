## About ##

PHP Picture Index is a free, quick to install, image gallery script. PHPPI does not require any databases, all information is retrieved from the files/folders themselves. PHPPI was designed this way to eliminate logging into admin pages to upload images, categorise, etc.

## Features ##

  * GD support for dynamically creating thumbnails.
  * Admin Section.
  * Support for Mobile Safari ( iPhone, iPad, iPod ) and Android browsers.
  * Full image view with navigation.
  * Fancybox support.
  * Theme support.
  * JPEG, PNG and GIF support.

## Requirements ##

  * GD version 2.0 (if you want it to dynamically create your thumbnails).
  * GD (if used) must support JPEG, PNG and GIF.
  * Tested with PHP 5.3.2, may work with earlier versions.
  * Tested working with Firefox 11+ and Internet Explorer 7+. Should work fine on other browsers as well.
